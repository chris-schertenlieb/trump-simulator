>_Ever wished you had an unlimited supply of incoherent, barely intelligible Trump tweets? This is a python script to load an export of existing Trump tweets pulled from the Twitter API and run them through a machine learning algorithm (leveraging tensorflow) in order to produce your own wacky tweets._

Run the following before using this code

`pip install textgenrnn`

`pip install tensorflow`

and then run 'python test.py' when finished to execute this file
